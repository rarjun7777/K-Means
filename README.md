-> Performed K-Means Clustering on Malls_Customer.csv . People are segregated based on spending score .

# STEPS IN K-MEANS CLUSTERING

-> Importing the libraries

-> Importing the dataset

-> Using the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters

-> Training the K-Means model on the dataset

-> Visualising the clusters
